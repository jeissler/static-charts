## Vanilla JS Dynamic Gauge Charts

This is sample project to explore the [Chartist.js](https://gionkunz.github.io/chartist-js/) library and building responsive charts w/ dynamic data from a json data source using vanilla JS. Other goals where to use new features in ES6 and practice manipulating object and array data to return informative charts. Uses the fetch WebAPI to simulate obtaining dynamic data from an API service. 

_**Uses: ES6, Webpack, Babel, NPM, Yarn, Flexboxgrid, Chartist**_
